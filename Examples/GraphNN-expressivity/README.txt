This is a demo for an RBN implementation of ACR graph neural networks as described in:

Barceló, Pablo, et al. "The logical expressiveness of graph neural networks." International Conference on Learning Representations. 2019.

The .rdef data files are .rdef encodings of the data provided by Barceló, Pablo, et al.

Detailed documentation for this example to follow.
